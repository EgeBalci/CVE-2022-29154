# CVE-2022-29154

**Authors: Ege BALCI, Taha HAMAD**

This repository contains the [HIP2022](https://hackinparis.com/) presentation materials for **CVE-2022-29154** vulnerability. The full presentation recording is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3wIITLbS4) but the slides in the video are added later (offline) by the conference team and it is an old version hence missing a lot of pages and the demo video :/ The PDF in this repo is the actual presentation material used during the conference.
